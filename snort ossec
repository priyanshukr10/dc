## üîç Overview

| Feature    | **Snort (NIDS)**                        | **OSSEC (HIDS)**                    |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Type       | Network-based IDS                       | Host-based IDS                      |
| Monitoring | Network traffic                         | File integrity, logs, user activity |
| Best for   | Detecting intrusions across the network | Monitoring individual systems       |
| Deployment | On gateway or bridge                    | On each monitored host              |
| Detection  | Signature-based                         | Rule- and anomaly-based             |

## üõ†Ô∏è Part 1: Installing **Snort (NIDS)**

### ‚úÖ A. Requirements (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snort -y
```

> During installation, it will prompt for your **network interface** (e.g., `eth0`) and **home network CIDR** (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)

### ‚úÖ B. Configuration File

Main config:

```bash
/etc/snort/snort.conf
```

Set your **HOME\_NET**:

```bash
ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
```

### ‚úÖ C. Running Snort

Run in **NIDS mode**:

```bash
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
```

To test detection (run from another system on LAN):

```bash
ping -c 1 <snort_host_ip>
```

Snort will display detected packets.

## üõ°Ô∏è Part 2: Installing **OSSEC (HIDS)**

### ‚úÖ A. Download and Install (Linux Agent/Server)

```bash
curl -O https://updates.atomicorp.com/installers/atomic
sudo chmod +x atomic
sudo ./atomic
sudo apt install ossec-hids ossec-hids-server -y
```

> On Ubuntu, OSSEC can also be compiled manually for more control.

### ‚úÖ B. Configure OSSEC

Edit the main config:

```bash
sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
```

Enable file integrity checks, SSH monitoring, and active response.

### ‚úÖ C. Start OSSEC

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ossec
sudo systemctl start ossec
```

Log location:

```bash
/var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.log
```

## üîç Part 3: Compare Snort vs OSSEC

| Feature            | **Snort (NIDS)**                                  | **OSSEC (HIDS)**                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scope**          | Monitors **network traffic** in real-time         | Monitors **host logs, files, users**                               |
| **Detection**      | Signature-based (e.g., malware, port scans)       | Log-based & integrity checks                                       |
| **Location**       | At the edge of network (router/firewall)          | Installed on each host                                             |
| **Best for**       | Detecting attacks **before** they reach endpoints | Detecting **insider threats**, rootkits, unauthorized file changes |
| **Alerting**       | Console, logs, syslog                             | Email, log files, active response                                  |
| **Blocking**       | Only with inline IPS setup                        | Built-in active response (e.g., block IP via firewall)             |
| **Resource usage** | Moderate                                          | Low to moderate                                                    |
| **Complexity**     | Advanced (ruleset management, tuning)             | Simpler setup, especially for small deployments                    |

## üß™ Example Use Cases

| Use Case                                            | Recommended Tool  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Detecting port scans or DDoS attempts               | Snort             |
| Monitoring changes to `/etc/passwd` or `sudoers`    | OSSEC             |
| Detecting malware command-and-control communication | Snort             |
| Tracking failed SSH logins or brute-force attacks   | OSSEC             |
| Compliance (PCI, HIPAA, etc.)                       | OSSEC (logs, FIM) |

## üìà Integrating Both (NIDS + HIDS)

For best protection:

* Use **Snort** at your network gateway (e.g., pfSense or Linux bridge)
* Use **OSSEC** on servers and endpoints

This gives layered defense across network **and** host.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Notes

* **Snort** can also be upgraded to **Snort3**, which is faster and modular.
* For HIDS alternatives, consider **Wazuh** (OSSEC fork with a web dashboard).
* Integrate alerts from both into a SIEM like **Splunk** or **ELK** for central monitoring.

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Running a Local Network Scan Using OpenVAS

### Step 1: Install OpenVAS (via GVM)

If you're on Kali Linux or Debian-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openvas
```

Then set it up:

```bash
sudo gvm-setup
sudo gvm-check-setup
```

### Step 2: Start OpenVAS Services

```bash
sudo gvm-start
```

This will start the web interface, usually at:
➡️ `https://127.0.0.1:9392`

Login with the credentials shown during setup (or create a new one using `gvm-manage-certs` if needed).

### Step 3: Access the Web UI

* Open your browser and go to: `https://127.0.0.1:9392`
* Login with your credentials.

   * Go to **Configuration > Targets**
   * Click **"Create Target"**
   * Enter IP range of your network (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)
   * Choose scan options (e.g., Alive Test: "ICMP, TCP-ACK Service & ARP Ping")

2. **Create a Task:**

   * Go to **Scans > Tasks**
   * Click **"New Task"**
   * Choose your created target
   * Select a scan config like **"Full and fast"**

3. **Start the Task:**

   * Select your task
   * Click the play icon ▶️ to begin the scan
